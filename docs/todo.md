# TODO: Parity with pre-commit

This page tracks gaps that prevent `prek` from being a drop-in replacement for `pre-commit`.

## Subcommands not implemented

All major subcommands of `pre-commit` have been implemented in `prek`.

!!! Note "pre-commit hazmat"

    The new `pre-commit hazmat` subcommand introduced in pre-commit [v4.5.0](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/releases/tag/v4.5.0) is a bit niche and unlikely to be widely used. It is not currently implemented in `prek`.

## Language support status

See [Language Support](languages.md) for the current list of supported and unsupported languages, plus prek-specific notes.
