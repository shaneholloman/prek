!!! note

    Although prek is pretty new, it's already powering real‑world projects like [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi), and more projects are picking it up—see [Who is using prek?](#who-is-using-prek). If you're looking for an alternative to `pre-commit`, please give it a try—we'd love your feedback!

## Where to Start

- New to `prek`: start with [Installation](installation.md), then follow the [Quickstart](quickstart.md).
- Already set up: use [Running Hooks](running-hooks.md) for day-to-day commands and handling hook failures.
- Replacing another hook tool: follow [Migrating from Other Hook Tools](migration.md).
- Writing config: read [Configuration](configuration.md), then use the [Configuration Reference](reference/configuration.md) for exact keys.
- Defining hooks directly in your project configuration: use [Local Hooks](local-hooks.md).
- Adding repository checks to a pipeline: see [Continuous Integration](ci.md).
- Looking for setup patterns: browse the [Cookbook](cookbook.md).
- Working in a monorepo: see [Monorepos](monorepos.md).
- Looking for flags or environment variables: use the [CLI Reference](reference/cli.md) and [Environment Variable Reference](reference/environment-variables.md).
- Reviewing trust and pinning choices: read the [Security Guide](security.md).
